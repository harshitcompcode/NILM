The authors also propose a new signature for NILM that is based on the wavelet transform. The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique that can be used to decompose a signal into its constituent frequency components. The authors argue that the wavelet transform is well-suited for NILM because it can capture the unique frequency signatures of different appliances.
