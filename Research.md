The authors also propose a new signature for NILM that is based on the wavelet transform. The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique that can be used to decompose a signal into its constituent frequency components. The authors argue that the wavelet transform is well-suited for NILM because it can capture the unique frequency signatures of different appliances.

The proposed NILM approach works as follows:

The voltage and current measurements are collected from the distribution system.
The wavelet transform is applied to the voltage and current measurements to extract the wavelet signatures.
The wavelet signatures are fed into the deep learning model to predict the power consumption of individual appliances.
